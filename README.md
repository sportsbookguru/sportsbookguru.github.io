## How to make $$ from online sportsbooks

With online sports gambling becoming legal in so many states, a huge number of online sportsbooks are being created, and all of them are fighting for your business. Think back to the days when Uber and Lyft were competing by giving out free rides, or food delivery apps were giving out free meals.  The same thing is going on today with online sportsbooks, except rather than rides or food, **they are giving you cash!**  By simply taking advantage of these sportsbook promotions, **I have made over $7,000 in the past year**, and I will show you how to do the same, with limited to no risk and effort.

### Sports Betting 101
For those new to sports betting, it can be a bit intimidating, but once you learn a few basics, it is actually quite simple. The section will first help you understand odds, or the risk/reward associated with a bet. Then we will cover a few of the more common types of bets.

#### Understanding Odds
Odds tell you how much potential winnings you can make on a particular bet, so when considering whether or not to place a bet, the odds are an important factor.  
The blue text in the image below are the odds associated with different types of bets. 
<img src="docs/assets/StraightBet.PNG">
Odds are usually presented as either 
<ul>
  <li>how many dollars you would win off of a $100 bet.  This is any odds that are shown with a "+"</li>
  <li>how much you would have to bet to win $100. This is any odds that are shown with a "-"</li> 
</ul>

Generally, <i>positive</i> odds means you will win more than your stake, and <i>negative</i> odds means you will win less than your stake if your bet wins. +100 means your winnings will be equal to your stake.<br />
<i>The table below gives the net winnings off of a $100 bet at various odds:</i><br />
<img src="docs/assets/OddsTable.JPG">



#### Straight Bets
A straight bet is a bet on the outcome of a single event, such as who will win a match.  This is the most common type of bet that people make.  The image below shows the three main types of straight bets that can be made: spread, moneyline, or total (over/under).  This is very similar to what the interface will look like on any sportsbook, with each team being a row, and the spread, moneyline, and total score (over/under) being their own columns
<img src="docs/assets/StraightBet.PNG">

##### Spread Bets
Betting the spread of a match means you are betting on how many points a team would win or lose by.  In the above example, in the spread column, the black text (-3.5 and +3.5) tells you the <i>spread</i>.  This means that if you picked the Packers to beat the spread, they would have to win <i>by more than</i> 3.5 points in order for you to cover (win) your bet.  Conversely, if you bet on the Lions to cover the spread, as long as the Lions win outright, or lose by fewer than 3.5 points, you would win your bet.<br />

In this example, the spread includes a half-point so there could be no tie. If the spread were, for example -3 and +3, and the Packers won by exactly 3 points, then this would be a tie or <i>push</i>. When there is a push, your stake would be returned to you, but there are no winnings..

You'll notice the odds on this spread are -110 when betting on either team to cover. This is usually the case with spread bets, as the spread is meant to make either team <i>covering</i> more or less equally likely.

##### Moneyline Bets
A moneyline bet means you are picking a team to win outright.  Again in the above example, you can pick the Packers to win outright or the Lions to win outright.  Notice in this bet that the odds are singificantly different than in the spread bet.  This makes sense, as we see that the Packers are favored by 3 points (based on the spread). Therefore, picking the Packers to win outright is less risky than picking the Lions to win outright and so the potential payout of winning a moneyline bet on the Lions is higher (+154 vs. -184).

##### Total (Over/Under) Bets
Over/Under bets are different from spread or moneyline bets in that rather than picking a particular team to win or cover the spread, you are betting on the total score of the match. The black text in the above example tells you the line on the total score, and you can bet whether the total will be higher or lower than that. In this example we see the total line is set at 44.5.  The top row lets you choose the over (indicated by the "o 44.5"), and the bottom row lets you chooose the under (indicated by the "u 44.5").

Notice again that similar to the spread bet, we see odds of -110 if you pick the over or if you pick the under. This is again because the total line is supposed to be set so that hitting the over or under are (generally) equally likely.

#### Prop Bets
Prop bets are different from straight bets in that they allow you to bet on specific events occurring within a match. Prop bets are generally structured the same as either moneyline bets or over/unders. Some examples of prop bets are called out below for now. We will get into prop bets in much more detail in future sections.
<ul>
  <li>Player Prop:  Bet on a player to record over/under 5 catches</li>
  <li>Player Prop: Bet on whether or not a player will score</li>
  <li>Game Prop: Bet on the longest passing touchdown to be over/under a certain number of yards</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

#### Parlays
A parlay is just a bet that combines 2 or more bets of any of the above types. If you place a 2-bet parlay, you are betting you will win Bet #1 AND Bet #2. If either of these bets loses in a parlay, you lose the entire bet. Beacuase of this, typically parlay's have higher payouts than if you were to just make each bet independently.


### How To Guarantee Winnings From Risk Free Bets
There are ways to guarantee that you will net a positive return with the sign-up bonuses highlighted below.  here are the details on how to do so.

#### Strategy 1: For books that award "Free Bet" stake when "Free Bets" are won
**$1,000 Risk Free Bet = $410 guaranteed**<br />
**Applies to:** Fanduel Sportsbook, Barstool Sportsbook

<ol>
  <li>Find a buddy</li>
  <li>Sign up using the instructions & links provided in the section below and deposit funds to receive your risk free bet promo</li>
  <li>Find an event that has a half point spread (e.g. -5.5 and +5.5) and even odds on both sides of the line (usually -110 on each side is the best you will see)</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>The half point spread ensures there is no possibility of a tie</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>You & your buddy each bet on opposite sides of this line (e.g. you bet Home team to cover -5.5 and your friend bets Away team to cover +5.5, both at -110 odds). This way, you guarantee one of you will win and one of you will lose</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>At -110, a $1,000 bet will net you $910, so if you win you will have $1,910 and your friend will have a $1,000 free bet credit</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>Repeat steps 3 & 4 for the same amount</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If you win, you will now have $1,910 + $910 = $2,820 and your friend will have $0. Split the total so you each receive $1,410.</li>
    <li>If you lose, you will now have $910 and your friend will have $1,910, for a total of $2,820.  Split the total so you each receive $1,410.</li>
    <li>After accounting for the $1,000 initially deposited, you each net $410 absolutely guaranteed</li>
  </ol>
</ol> 

Refer to the below table for each pososible scenario and outcome if the above steps are followed
<img src="docs/assets/S1Table.JPG">

#### Strategy 2: For books that do not award "Free Bet" stake when "Free Bets" are won
**$1,000 Risk Free Bet = $170 guaranteed**<br />
**Applies to:** Caesars, Twinspires, Pointsbet, BetMGM

<ol>
  <li>Find a buddy</li>
  <li>Sign up using the instructions & links in the section below and deposit funds to receive your risk free bet promo</li>
  <li>Find an event that has a half point spread (e.g. -5.5 and +5.5) and even odds on both sides of the line (usually -110 on each side is the best you will see)</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>The half point spread ensures there is no possibility of a tie</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>You & your buddy each bet on opposite sides of this line (e.g. you bet Home team to cover -5.5 and your friend bets Away team to cover +5.5, both at -110 odds). This way, you guarantee one of you will win and one of you will lose</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>At -110, a $1,000 bet will net you $910, so if you win you will have $1,910 and your friend will have a $1,000 free bet credit</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>Repeat steps 3 & 4, however whoever won the first bet will need to alter the bet amount of the second bet</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If your friend has a $1,000 free bet credit, then the total <i>winnings</i> they could be awarded is only $910, as the free bet staked will not be awarded back as well</li>
    <li>If you won the first bet, then the second bet placed should only be $475. <i>Assumes odds of -110 on each side. If odds are different, this bet amount will differ</i></li>
    <ol>
      <li>If you win, you will now have $1,910 + $431(your winnings) = $2,341 and your friend will have $0. Split the total so you each receive $1,170</li>
      <li>If you lose, you will now have $1,910 - $475 = $1,435 and your friend will have $910 (since the $1,000 free bet is not credited back), for a total of $2,345.  Split the total so you each receive $1,172</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>After accounting for the $1,000 initially deposited, you each net ~$170 absolutely guaranteed</li>
</ol>


Refer to the below table for each pososible scenario and outcome if the above steps are followed
<img src="docs/assets/S2Table.JPG">


#### Strategy 3: Specific for Mavercik Sports (Deposit match + free bet promo)
**$300 deposit match + $300 risk-free bet = $185 guaranteed**<br />
**Applies to:** Maverick Sports
Strategy is basically the same as strategy #2 above, just with different bet amounts for bet #1 and Bet #2. Refer to the table below<br />
