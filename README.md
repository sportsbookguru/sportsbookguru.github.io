## How to make $$ from online sportsbooks

With online sports gambling becoming legal in so many states, a huge number of online sportsbooks are being created, and all of them are fighting for your business. Think back to the days when Uber and Lyft were competing by giving out free rides, or food delivery apps were giving out free meals.  The same thing is going on today with online sportsbooks, except rather than rides or food, **they are giving you cash!**  By simply taking advantage of these sportsbook promotions, **I have made over $7,000 in the past year**, and I will show you how to do the same, with limited to no risk and effort.



### Sign-Up Bonuses

The easiest way to make money quickly is by taking advantage of the new user promos that many books are offering.  Below I have detailed a list of my favorite sign-up bonuses and the best way to take advantage of them. See "How to remove risk" section that follows for more details on how to combine sign-up bonuses for **guaranteed cash**.

### How To Guarantee Winnings From The Above Promos
There are ways to guarantee that you will net a positive return with the sign-up bonuses highlighted above.  Below are the details on how to do so.

#### Strategy 1: For books that award "Free Bet" stake when "Free Bets" are won
**$1,000 Risk Free Bet = $410**
**Applies to:** Fanduel Sportsbook, Barstool Sportsbook


1. Find a buddy
2. Sign up using the instructions & links above and deposit funds to receive your risk free bet promo
3. Find an event that has a half point spread (e.g. -5.5 and +5.5) and even odds on both sides of the line (usually -110 on each side is the best you will see)
4. You & your buddy each bet on opposite sides of this line (e.g. you bet Home team to cover -5.5 and your friend bets Away team to cover +5.5, both at -110 odds). This way, you guarantee one of you will win and one of you will lose
5. At -110, a $1,000 bet will net you $910, so if you win you will have $1,910 and your friend will have a $1,000 free bet credit
6. Repeat steps 3 & 4 for the same amount
7. If you win, you will now have $1,910 + $910 = $2,820 and your friend will have $0. Split the total so you each receive $1,410.
8. If you lose, you will now have $910 and your friend will have $1,910, for a total of $2,820.  Split the total so you each receive $1,410.
9. After accounting for the $1,000 initially deposited, you each net $410 absolutely guaranteed
