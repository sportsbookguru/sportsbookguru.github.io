## How to make $$ from online sportsbooks!

With online sports gambling becoming legal in so many states, a huge number of online sportsbooks are being created, and all of them are fighting for your business. Think back to the days when Uber and Lyft were competing by giving out free rides, or food delivery apps were giving out free meals.  The same thing is going on today with online sportsbooks, except rather than rides or food, **they are giving you cash!**  By simply taking advantage of these sportsbook promotions, **I have made over $7,000 in the past year**, and I will show you how to do the same, with limited to no risk and effort.



### Sign-Up Bonuses

The easiest way to make money quickly is by taking advantage of the new user promos that many books are offering.  Below I have detailed a list of my favorite sign-up bonuses and the best way to take advantage of them.

        <li>on Fanduel, when bets made with site credit are won, you also receive the site credit as cash (if I win a $1,000 bet made on credit, with +100 odds, I receive $2,000 total)</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep in mind that with Caesars, "free bet" credits do not get credited back into your account if you win, as with fanduel.  if you win a $1,000 free bet from Caesars at +100 odds, the cash into your account will be the $1,000 winnings, rather than the $1,000 stake + $1,000 winnings</li>
        <li>That being said, this is still a great intro offer because you receive the credit regardless of whether your bet wins or loses</li>

        <li>The free bet credit up to $500 on the fixed odds bet is straightforward and similar to the promos with Fanduel and Caesars. definitely should take advantage of this</li>
        <li>PointsBetting wagers are unique to pointsbet. with PointsBetting, if you win your bet by 2 points, you win 2*(your bet amount); if you lose your bet by 2 points, you lose 2*(your bet amount).  Because of this, do not bet the full $1,500 becuase if you lose by more than 1 point, you will not be refunded by your full loss amount</li>
