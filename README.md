## How to make $$ from online sportsbooks

With online sports gambling becoming legal in so many states, a huge number of online sportsbooks are being created, and all of them are fighting for your business. Think back to the days when Uber and Lyft were competing by giving out free rides, or food delivery apps were giving out free meals.  The same thing is going on today with online sportsbooks, except rather than rides or food, **they are giving you cash!**  By simply taking advantage of these sportsbook promotions, **I have made over $7,000 in the past year**, and I will show you how to do the same, with limited to no risk and effort.

### Sports Betting 101
For those new to sports betting, it can be a bit intimidating, but once you learn a few basics, it is actually quite simple. The section will first help you understand odds, or the risk/reward associated with a bet. Then we will cover a few of the more common types of bets.

#### Understanding Odds
Odds tell you how much potential winnings you can make on a particular bet, so when considering whether or not to place a bet, the odds are an important factor.  
The blue text in the image below are the odds associated with different types of bets. 
<img src="docs/assets/StraightBet.png">
Odds are usually presented as either 
<ul>
  <li>how many dollars you would win off of a $100 bet.  This is any odds that are shown with a "+"</li>
  <li>how much you would have to bet to win $100. This is any odds that are shown with a "-"</li> 
</ul>

Generally, positive odds means you will win more than your stake if your bet wins, and negative odds means you will win less than your stake if your bet wins. +100 means your winnings will be equal to your stake.
Therefore, if you have odds of +150, this means that a $100 bet will net you $150 of winnings ($250 total returned to you).
Conversely, if you have odds of -150, this means that a $100 bet will net you $100 * $100/$150 = $66 ($166 total returned to you).  Said another way, you would need to bet $150 to win $100.


  
  


#### Straight Bets
A straight bet is any bet based on the outcome of an event.  This is the most common type of bets that people make - an example of this would be picking one team to win a certain match.  The image below shows the three main types of straight bets that can be made: spread, moneyline, or total (over/under).  This is very similar to what the interface will look like on any sportsbook.

##### Spread Bets
Betting the spread of a match means you are betting on how many points a team would win or lose by.  In the above example, in the spread column, the plack text (-3 and +3) tells you the <i>spread</i>.  This means that if you picked the Packers to beat the spread, they would have to win <i>by more than</i> 3 points in order for you to cover (win) your bet.  Conversely, if you bet on the Lions to cover the spread, as long as the Lions win or lose by fewer than 3 points, you would win your bet.




### How To Guarantee Winnings From Risk Free Bets
There are ways to guarantee that you will net a positive return with the sign-up bonuses highlighted above.  Below are the details on how to do so.

#### Strategy 1: For books that award "Free Bet" stake when "Free Bets" are won
**$1,000 Risk Free Bet = $410**
**Applies to:** Fanduel Sportsbook, Barstool Sportsbook

<ol>
  <li>Find a buddy</li>
  <li>Sign up using the instructions & links above and deposit funds to receive your risk free bet promo</li>
  <li>Find an event that has a half point spread (e.g. -5.5 and +5.5) and even odds on both sides of the line (usually -110 on each side is the best you will see)</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>The half point spread ensures there is no possibility of a tie</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>You & your buddy each bet on opposite sides of this line (e.g. you bet Home team to cover -5.5 and your friend bets Away team to cover +5.5, both at -110 odds). This way, you guarantee one of you will win and one of you will lose</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>At -110, a $1,000 bet will net you $910, so if you win you will have $1,910 and your friend will have a $1,000 free bet credit</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>Repeat steps 3 & 4 for the same amount</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If you win, you will now have $1,910 + $910 = $2,820 and your friend will have $0. Split the total so you each receive $1,410.</li>
    <li>If you lose, you will now have $910 and your friend will have $1,910, for a total of $2,820.  Split the total so you each receive $1,410.</li>
    <li>After accounting for the $1,000 initially deposited, you each net $410 absolutely guaranteed</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

#### Strategy 2: For books that do not award "Free Bet" stake when "Free Bets" are won
**$1,000 Risk Free Bet = $170**<br />
**Applies to:** Caesars, Twinspires, Pointsbet

<ol>
  <li>Find a buddy</li>
  <li>Sign up using the instructions & links above and deposit funds to receive your risk free bet promo</li>
  <li>Find an event that has a half point spread (e.g. -5.5 and +5.5) and even odds on both sides of the line (usually -110 on each side is the best you will see)</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>The half point spread ensures there is no possibility of a tie</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>You & your buddy each bet on opposite sides of this line (e.g. you bet Home team to cover -5.5 and your friend bets Away team to cover +5.5, both at -110 odds). This way, you guarantee one of you will win and one of you will lose</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>At -110, a $1,000 bet will net you $910, so if you win you will have $1,910 and your friend will have a $1,000 free bet credit</i></li>
  </ol>
  <li>Repeat steps 3 & 4, however whoever won the first bet will need to alter the bet amount of the second bet</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If your friend has a $1,000 free bet credit, then the total <i>winnings</i> they could be awarded is only $910, as the free bet staked will not be awarded back as well</li>
    <li>If you won the first bet, then the second bet placed should only be $475. <i>Assumes odds of -110 on each side. If odds are different, this bet amount will differ</i></li>
    <ol>
      <li>If you win, you will now have $1,910 + $431(your winnings) = $2,341 and your friend will have $0. Split the total so you each receive $1,170</li>
      <li>If you lose, you will now have $1,910 - $475 = $1,435 and your friend will have $910 (since the $1,000 free bet is not credited back), for a total of $2,345.  Split the total so you each receive $1,172</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>After accounting for the $1,000 initially deposited, you each net ~$170 absolutely guaranteed</li>
</ol>
